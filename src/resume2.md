## Profile

I have a decade of experience managing large-scale websites for the US government, focusing on content strategy, accessibility, workflow automation, and cross-team collaboration. As a certified 508 Trusted Tester, I strive to make digital content usable, clear, and inclusive. I’m drawn to roles that bridge technical and editorial work: streamlining systems, leading redesigns, and helping teams communicate better. I'm driven by creating practical, user-focused solutions that make a meaningful impact.
